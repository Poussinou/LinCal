About
-----
"LinCal" is short for "Link Calendar" and is an Android app which allows to show small messages or other content at predefined points in time, in the form of notifications. If the message is a link, it can be opened by clicking the notification. Calendars are created as a text file using a simple format and can then be loaded into the app.
